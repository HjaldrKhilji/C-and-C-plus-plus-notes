(n*i)+1(for the node class declaration) is the grwoth of functions when a new "node"(the class on which visitor operates on) class is added, n is the amount visitor classes and 
i is the amount(arguments of functions) of double dispatches. For the simple ordiniary dynamic dispatch it is n^i, i(arguments of functions) is the amount of double dispatchs
and n is the amount of classes that already exist plus the new class. when a new visitor class is added then nothing changes for any node class.
To recall what the visitor pattern and the "simple dynamic dispatch" method is, go to:
