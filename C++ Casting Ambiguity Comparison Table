-----------------------------------------------------

| Feature | Upcasting (Toward Base Class) | Downcasting (Toward Derived Class) |
|---------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Typical Operation: | Derived* to Base* | Base* to Derived* |
| Primary Cast Types: | static_cast, dynamic_caste | static_cast (unsafe) or dynamic_cast (safe) | --NOTE-- Though you can technically use any other cast types, but PLEASE DONT.
| Ambiguity Type 1: Member Access | Accessing a non-static member inherited via multiple paths (non-virtual inheritance) without qualification. | Simply not applicable | 
| Ambiguity Type 2: Pointer Conversion | Conversion to a base pointer where the derived object contains multiple subobjects of that base type (e.g., in non-virtual Diamond Inheritance). | Conversion to a derived pointer where the base object could belong to different derived types. (This is usually just an invalid/unsafe cast). |
| Detection for Ordinary (Non-Virtual) Bases: | guaranteed TO BE caught at Compile Time. The compiler must determine which base subobject to point to. | Always detectable(detectable dosent mean that the compiler will detect them, it means that it is unspecified, but technically possible) at Compile Time. |
| Detection for Virtual Bases: | Always caught at Compile Time. The compiler must resolve the single shared base subobject. | Run Time Detection (RTTI) is Required if the full class lattice is unknown(not in the same translation unit). |
| Casting Operator for Ambiguity Handling: | static_cast will report ambiguities at compile time, and dynamic cast will do it at runtime. Using reinterpret_cast will unsurprisingly lead to undefined behavior  | dynamic_cast is required for safe downcasting and to check if the pointer is truly of the target type (e.g., checking if ps is a Component* in your example), static cast will throw errors, and unsurprisingly again, the result of reinterpret_cast is undefined |
| Safety/Outcome on Failure: | Compiler Error. | static_cast/reinterpret_cast: Undefined Behavior (UB) upon use. dynamic_cast: Defined Behavior (nullptr for pointers, or std::bad_cast for references).
