Introduction:
Now I know what you're thinking:
function overloading at runtime sounds insanse and impossible,
but if you look around at the visitor pattern, you will realize that its not.
To the point:
basicaly, when you look at a virtual table in c++,
you will realize that every entry with a different function signature has a different entry,
so say you have two functions and both are named A1, both of them are virtual(they have to be for this technique to work) and are in a class named C, one takes an int and the other takes a float,
now you have two other virtual functions named B that are implemented in two classes as follows:
class 1's B calls function A1(int)
class 2's B calls function A2(float)
now imagine an object of class 1 will call A1(4), so
what happens in the call of A1(4)?
well, as we all know every polymorphic object has a vptr with it,
and the vptr is pointing to the vtable of the underlying class,
now the thing is that since the vtable of C has two different entries for the function A1, hence
at runtime, the entry lookup will look for that specific entry for each classes function at runtime.
if the functions named B werent virtual then obviously the 
intent would not have been to do overloading at runtime and instead it would be to do it at compile time.
