This file will contain small important concepts, just for reference, and will expand with time:
to search points related to a topic, say static, search that topic in the file, and make the topic uppercase.
dont use upper case for anything else other than aiding in search for topics.
Point 1: 
STATIC MEMBER RELATED RULE:
static members arent replicated during inheritance, even when you are inheriting from a specialization of a template.
for example:
//find the headers yourself
struct A {
    static int a;
    virtual void b(){std::cout<<"h";}  //structs and classes are the same thing except for the fact that struct members are public by default

};
struct B: public A<int>{

};
template <>
int A<int>::a = 10;

int main() {
    std::cout<<B::a; //10
    return 0;
}
Point 2:
ENUMS RELATED RULE:
The out-of-class definition of a member enumeration is only allowed for an enumeration for which
we know the underlying type, in other words, you have to use the underlying type of a enum or a enum class when defining it outside the class
that it was declared in. the same applies to enum/enum_class members of class template. if you dont explicitly define a underlying type for a enum then you cant 
define the enum in a out of class defintion, and again, the same applies to enum/enum_class members of class template.
 example of out of class definitions of an enum class:
struct A{
    enum class a:short;
};

template <typename b>
enum class A<b>::a:short{a1,b2,c};
template <>
enum class A<int>::a:short{a1,b2,c, d};
