This file will contain small important concepts, just for reference, and will expand with time:
Point 1: 
static members arent replicated during inheritance, even when you are inheriting from a specialization of a template.
for example:
#include <iostream>
#include <cstddef>  // Required for offsetof
#include <iomanip>  // Required for output formatting
#include <type_traits> // Required for alignof
#include<concepts>
template<std::integral T>
struct A {
    static int a;
    virtual void b(){std::cout<<"h";}  //structs and classes are the same thing except for the fact that struct members are public by default

};
struct B: public A<int>{

};
template <>
int A<int>::a = 10;

int main() {
    std::cout<<B::a; //10
    return 0;
}
