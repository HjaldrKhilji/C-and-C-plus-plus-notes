Value oriented programming differs from OOP in:
Value oriented objects are required 
to be able to be allocated on stack.


Value oriented programming
emphasizes encapsulation only as a
way of hiding implementation, while
OOP supports encapsulation even if it
hides the underlying conceptual values. 
While value oriented programming never
hides conceptual values, it only hides 
the representation of those values.
note:if a vop object is a part of 
another vop class implementation,
then the vop class can encapsulate it
as long as its not a conceptual
part of the target value type.

Value oriented programming's 
identity is it's value, while an 
objects identity is it's address.

Value oriented programming should
generally be immutable, a good way 
to achieve this is to use helper
functions for implementing the 
notion of common operators, 
instead of member operator 
functions because using helper
functions would force the usage of
move and copy operator after every
operation. A built in type is a 
value oriented objects, and when 
you do a operation on it, it 
completely changes, so while it's 
mutable as a value, it is immutable
as a object(you cant just change a single
bit directly).
The same should apply
to all value oriented objects.

Value oriented objects are normally 
inclined towards copying the 
conceptual value instead of the
representation itself.
While object oriented objects are 
inclined to copy representation itself.
This point isn't a rule of thumb,
just a typical thing.

Object oriented programming is used 
to immiate objects with behaviours,
while value oriented programming
is meant to immatate values with 
semantics. Behaviour can be
non determentistic through 
polymorphism, but sementics is always
determentistic. So its safe to say 
that OOP is a non determentistic
style of programming, while VOP is a
deterministic one. A OOP object
might hide the value, but will never hide
the behaviour, and its behavior may be
non determentistic(polymorphic) in some
contexts(contexts where its accessed by
a certian base class interface), but
its always a good idea to keep
exactly one interface to every (inherited)
form of a class well documented(making it
determentistic if accessed by that interface).
In this case, I say interface as in class.

inheritance is generally allowed for 
A VOP as long
as everh interface to the VOP is non
polymorphic, and the notation of the
interface is well documented. That being 
said, inheritance isnt allowed for VOP's
in C++. why is that? well its because
built in types cant be inherited from,
and they are VOP's, hence to mantain
concistancy, dont inherit from VOP
unless you are writing a non VOP type.
the language wont stop you, but breaking
this rule isnt good for consistency.
even inheriting from a VOP in the code of
a non VOP class isnt recommended.
the reason that inheriting from a vop
for non vop class isnt as bad, as it is
for a vop inheriting from another vop
is because we are breaking consistency,
but we can still reason about the resulting
non vop class because the non vop classes
main goal is not to help you reason
about its value, but rather its behaviour,
while a vop goal is to help you 
reason about its value, and inhering
from a vop as a vop will make the notion
of the value represented hard, which
is something that matters for VOP's.





C++ abstraction mechanism supports 
both, and that's why we love c++ ❤️❤️.

it only took 3 hours to read and write 
this summary, so it may not be
well writtenn when it comes to the
grammmer.
