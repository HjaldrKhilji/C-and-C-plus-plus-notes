Value oriented programming differs from OOP in:
Value oriented objects are required 
to be able to be allocated on stack.


Value oriented programming
emphasizes encapsulation only as a
way of hiding implementation, while
OOP supports encapsulation even if it
hides the underlying conceptual values. 
While value oriented programming never
hides conceptual values, it only hides 
the representation of those values.

Value oriented programming's 
identity is it's value, while an 
objects identity is it's address.

Value oriented programming should
generally be immutable, a good way 
to achieve this is to use helper
functions for implementing the 
notion of common operators, 
instead of member operator 
functions because using helper
functions would force the usage of
move and copy operator after every
operation. A built in type is a 
value oriented objects, and when 
you do a operation on it, it 
completely changes, so while it's 
mutable as a value, it is immutable
as a object. The same should apply
to all value oriented objects.

Value oriented objects are normally 
inclined towards copying the 
conceptual value instead of the
representation itself.
While object oriented objects are 
inclined to copy representation itself.
This point isn't a rule of thumb,
just a typical thing.

Object oriented programming is used 
to immiate objects with behaviours,
while value oriented programming
is meant to immatate values with 
semantics. Behaviour can be
non determentistic through 
polymorphism, but sementics is always
determentistic. So its safe to say 
that OOP is a non determentistic
style of programming, while VOP is a
deterministic one.

C++ abstraction mechanism supports 
both, and that's why we love c++ ❤️❤️.
