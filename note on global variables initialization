    I am saying that
    global variables won't
    be gurrentied to be initialized 
    if main isn't
    executed, this 
    means that 
    dynamically linked 
    libraries should
    not have global
    variables.
    
    this DOES NOT apply
    if and only if the initializer is
    a constant expression
    
    this may apply to other
    things other than dynamically
    linked libraries, but i cant
    think of those examples,
    hence not sure.

    All of this dosent however 
change the fact that global 
variables are Initialized
before main() is executed

The application of this rule 
on dynamically linked libraries 
is just a rule of thumb, though 
in other cases it might or might not be 
a absolute rule, i am not sure.
