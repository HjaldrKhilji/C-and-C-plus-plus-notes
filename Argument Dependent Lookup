Basically if you pass a entity from a namespace "A", or a any member of a class of namespace "A" to a function, then the function will be looked up for in that namespace "A", this also applies if 
namespace "A" is the global namespace. If multiple matches are found using Argument dependent lookup and the normal function lookup mechanism, then function resolution mechanisms wont give precedence
of the one found using Argument dependent lookup over the other functions, and instead the call will be ambigoius. Argument dependent lookup also applies to template arguments.
